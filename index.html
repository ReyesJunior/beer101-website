			<h2 class="what-is-beer title">What is Beer?</h2>
			<p class="what-is-beer body teaser-text">Let's start with the basics! Beer is an alcoholic beverage that is made from the fermentation of barley, hops, yeast, and water. Barley is a type of grain that is rich in starch and the main ingredient for making beer, it's analogous to grapes being the main ingredient for wine.</p>
			<p class="what-is-beer body complete-text">To make beer, you first must brew it. To brew it means to ferment it. The beer brewing process requires that you ferment a carbohyadate source (mainly barley, but it can technically come from any carbohydrate) and extract it's sugar supply. Once the sugar is free, yeast is added to the mix to begin fermentation. The fermentation process produces alcohol and carbon dioxide. Once the fermentation is completed, you have created beer!</p>
			<p class="what-is-beer body complete-text">Popular to contrary belief, beer "is not made from" hops. Hops contain essential oils and resins (sticky and flammable organic substances) and are used as an ingredient to add some "spice" to the beer's flavor. Hops are known for their distinctive bitterness and "hoppy" flavor.</p>
