			<h2 class="brewing title">Brewing Beer</h2>
			<p class="brewing body">Beer and beer brewing have a very long and rich history. It is suspected that humankind's first encounter with alcoholic beverages was by chance. Who discovered it? How? When? No one knows for sure, but It is believed that the first human to drink beer found it in a closed fruit jar that contained honey. Archaeological excavations have discovered jars containing the remains of alcoholic beverages that are over 7,000 years old! How did this chance discovery lead to the development of beer and the beer industry that we see today?</p>
			<p class="brewing body complete-text">Over the course of human history, brewers have been using a system of trial and error and careful observation, to brew beer. Different cultures began producing fermented beverages, each with their own recipe that was unique to the region. At the time, people knew that leaving fruits and grains that were stored in covered containers for a long time produced wine and beer, but no one fully understood why their recipes worked.</p>
			<p class="brewing body complete-text">The process that we now call fermentation, comes from the Latin word of “fervere", which means "to boil”. The name came from brewers observing the bubbles that emerged from the liquids kept in the large vessels. To them, it appeared as though the contained liquid was boiling. After observing this process, brewers began to experiment and eventually figured out the intricacies of the brewing-process.</p>

			<h2 class="brewing-slides title">The beer-brewing process</h2>
			<p class="brewing-slides body">Producing beer used to be tricky. If the mixture did not stand long enough, the product contained no alcohol.  If the mixture stood out for too long, it rotted and was undrinkable. Throughout the centuries, beer brewers used their observations, and their accumulation of knowledge about the fermentation process, to learn which temperatures and how much air exposure were key to the beer brewing process.</p>
			<p class="brewing body complete-text">The first objective in brewing beer is to extract and release the sugar from the carbohydrate source of choice (mainly barley, but it can technically come from any carbohydrate). Once the sugar is free, yeast is added to the mix to begin the fermentation. The beer brewing process has seven stages, each is essential to the production of beer. Check out the seven steps of the beer-brewing process below!</p>

<!-- Slide 1 -->
			       <div class="slide-card">
			           <h4 class="step-title">Step 1</h4>
			           <h2 class="step-name">Mashing</h2>
			           <div class="step-description">Mashing is the process of mixing milled grain with water and heating this mixture up. The milled grain is typically malted barley with supplementary grains such as corn, sorghum, rye, or wheat.</div>
			           <div class="step-description">Mashing involves pauses at certain temperatures in order to allow the enzymes in the malt to break down the starch in the grain into sugars. The resulting product is called a "mash".</div>
			       </div>
<!-- Slide 2 -->
			       <div class="slide-card">
			           <h4 class="step-title">Step 2</h4>
			           <h2 class="step-name">Lautering</h2>
			           <div class="step-description">Lautering is a process to separate the mash into wort (a clear liquid) and residual grain. It consists of 3 steps: Mashout, recirculation, and sparging.</div>
			           <div class="step-description">The mashout raises the mash (to 77C) to stop the enzymatic conversion of starches, this makes the mash and wort more fluid.</div>
			           <div class="step-description">Recirculation is the removal of the wort from the bottom of the mash and adding it to the top. This will filter out any unwanted proteins and debris.</div>
			           <div class="step-description">Sparging is the trickling of water through the grain to extract sugars. </div>
			       </div>
<!-- Slide 3 -->
			       <div class="slide-card">
			           <h4 class="step-title">Step 3</h4>
			           <h2 class="step-name">Boiling</h2>
			           <div class="step-description">Wort is extracted from the previous 2 steps. In order to ensure that it is free from infections and sterile, the wort is boiled. The heat of the boil causes proteins in the wort to coagulate and lowere it's pH.</div>
			           <div class="step-description">During the boil, hops are added (contributing bitterness, flavor, and aroma to the beer).</div>
			       </div>
<!-- Slide 4 -->
			       <div class="slide-card">
			           <h4 class="step-title">Step 4</h4>
			           <h2 class="step-name">Fermenting</h2>
			           <div class="step-description">Once the wort cools, the fermentation process can begin. Yeast is added to the wort, causing the sugars to be metabolized into alcohol and CO2. The resulting product is now technically called beer.</div>
			           <div class="step-description">A bung device is often put on the tanks to allow the CO2 produced by the yeast to naturally carbonate the beer. The bung device can be set to a specific pressure to match the type of beer being produced.</div>
			       </div>
<!-- Slide 5 -->
			       <div class="slide-card">
			           <h4 class="step-title">Step 5</h4>
			           <h2 class="step-name">Conditioning</h2>
			           <div class="step-description">As the fermentation starts to slow down, the yeast begins to settle down to the bottom of the tank. To continue to encourage the settling of the yeast, the beer is cooled to near freezing.</div>
			           <div class="step-description">Cooling the beer to these temperatures makes the phenolic compounds (unpleasant flavors) insoluble, leading to a smoother tasting beer.</div>
			       </div>
<!-- Slide 6 -->
			       <div class="slide-card">
			           <h4 class="step-title">Step 6</h4>
			           <h2 class="step-name">Filtering</h2>
			           <div class="step-description">It's important to note that not all beer is filtered. Filtering the beer will stabilize the flavor. Filters range from "rough" filters (that remove much of the yeast and solids) to "fine" and "sterile" filters (that strain even more microorganisms fromthe beer).</div>
			           <div class="step-description">The filtration process affects the cloudiness and color of the beer. The more the beer is filtered, the clearer the beer is.</div>
			       </div>
<!-- Slide 7 -->
			       <div class="slide-card">
			           <h4 class="step-title">Step 7</h4>
			           <h2 class="step-name">Packaging</h2>
			           <div class="step-description">The final step for most (more on this later) beers is the packaging stage. Beers are either bottled up, put in a keg, or cans before they can leave the brewery.</div>
			       </div>
<!-- Slide 8 -->
			       <div class="slide-card">
			           <h4 class="step-title">BONUS</h4>
			           <h2 class="step-name">2nd Fermentation</h2>
			           <div class="step-description">Some beers require up to two fermentation cycles (sometimes even up to three) before they are ready to be distributed.</div>
			           <div class="step-description">In some instances, beer can undergo further fermentation inside their bottle packaging. The trapped CO2 in the bottle provides natural carbonation to the beer itself.</div>
